      <h1> Caitlyn's Trip </h1>
      <h1 class="textNYC"> The big apple, New York City! The lights, shopping, food, fashion, all sounds amazing right?!? Wellâ€¦.Let me tell you, NYC is amazing, but its not for all travelers. The subway was smelly and had rats. The people where not the very friendly. All you see is buildings or the water of the Hudson River. If you can look past all of the mess, you will have the time of your life! The lights, shopping, food and fashion is amazing! I love going to NYC and you might too!</h1>
