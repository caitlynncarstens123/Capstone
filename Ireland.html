      <h1> Caitlyn's Trip </h1>
      <h1 class="textIreland"> Ireland is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. Now since you know more history than a geography teacher, let me tell you the fun things about this green heaven. First the food is amazing! Second you MUST go to the Cliffs of Moher! Tired do something crazy, go cliff diving! Last but not least have fun! Try new things! Do things that scare you! Its an amazing place in the world and a must see for anyone at any age!
