      <p class="textHawaii">Oh Hawaii, the paradise in the Central Pacific. The islands that is known for their rugged landscapes of cliffs, waterfalls, tropical foliage and beaches with gold, red, black and even green sands. Of the 6 main islands, I went to Maui and Oahu. Maui is where I learned how to scuba diving and Oahu is where I learned how to surf at Waikiki beach. I had so much fun with my mom, sister and brother on this trip! I would recommend for anyone to go to Hawaii!</p>
