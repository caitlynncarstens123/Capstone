      <h1>Aisha's Trip</h1>
      <h1 class="textJapan">Visiting Japan was definitely an unforgettable experience. The way of life and culture of the Japanese people is fascinating to experience. The way of life of the Japanese is very different than the way of life in America. The societal norms are completely different than what I experience at home (America) and it is important to slowly pick up on them throughout the trip so that you blend in more. The Japanese are very very kind, however most of them do not speak English so make sure to use a lot hand motions! In Japan I used public transportation as it is the most popular way of travel in the country. I also lived in an air BnB which was a traditional Japanese home. I loved my experience in this country as it gave me a new perspective of the world and how countries could be so different from America.</h1>
