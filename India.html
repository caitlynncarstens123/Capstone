      <h1> Aisha's Trip </h1>
      <h1 class="textIndia"> India, also known as the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country and is the second most populated country in the world. I have been to India many times and had a lot of fun. Some of my favorite things I did in India was go to the Taj Mahal, eating amazing food and going to street markets! One thing that I did not love was the humanity and the mosquitos.
