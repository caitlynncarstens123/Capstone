<h1>Aisha's Trip</h1>
<h1>Costa Rica has been one of the most beautiful places I have visited as the greenery of this tropical landscape blows you away. I  had the opportunity to spot much of the wildlife that inhabits the rainforests and beaches of Costa Rica. Some of the wildlife I spotted included sloths, toucans, spider monkeys, bats, hermit crabs, iguanas, and dolphins. The highlight of my experience was how kind and caring the natives were to us tourists. Something to remember is that many of the people living in Costa Rica do not speak English however the people working at many of the tourist attractions are bilangual in Spanish and English.</h1>
